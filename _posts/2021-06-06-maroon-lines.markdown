### Introduction
Maroon Lines is a source code editor with in-built version controlling.

"Why not just use Git? That's the holy grail for version controlling" - That is definitely true. I believe so too. However, Git is more suited for projects. Maroon Lines tries to solve the problem for single files. 

Say you fire up your unregistered Sublime Text to solve a Leetcode or Kattis problem. You write code to solve it, submit it and it spectacularly fails. You go back to the drawing board to change your logic, and submit again. Fails again. You realise that the previous version was on the right track and just needed a little change. Unfortunately, you can't just jump back to a previous version - unless you had initialised a git repo (for a single file), which you did not. Who would initialise a repository for a single file?

Maroon Lines solves this problem by saving a version every time one saves his/her file. In addition, it also provides a intuitive way for the programmer to jump between versions easily - paving a way for one to store and view multiple solutions to a problem set in a single file.
