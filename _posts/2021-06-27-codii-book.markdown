### Introduction
Codii is a free-to-use address book catered to suit the needs of debt collectors. It can be used to track the amount of debt owed, manage deadlines, ban and unban debtors and even organise them by location.

This is specially designed for debt collectors. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). Debt collectors tend to make outbound telephone calls, take inbound telephone calls, and search for updated information on debtors daily. Thus, there is a real need for a simple yet efficient way to handle all these information. This address book aims to address this need.

Unique features:
- Automatic debt update based on interests
- Whitelist / Blacklist / Overdue list
- Export data in other formats
- Debt repayment progress bar and debt repayment status (overdue/completed/time left before payment deadline)
- Nearby persons panel (show contacts that live near a selected person)

### Usage
Codii is available for the Linux, Windows, and Mac OS operating systems.

1. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `codii.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
3. Double-click the file to start the app.
4. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

### Thoughts
This was my first formal software engineering project with 3 fellow schoolmates during our second year of computing degree. We had to build on a pre-existing address book (that was built using **Java**) and do our best to make it our own. I had taken 4 other modules that semester, but I do not really recall working on other modules as much as I did for this one.

This project was not really just about coding out a product - it actually entailed the entire process of product development. We drew up UML diagrams, discussed with prototypes, learned to pitch our product, wrote up lines and lines of documentation and most importantly, learned to work on an existing codebase - just like in the real world.

It was hard, but it taught me the relevant skills to work in a large team.
