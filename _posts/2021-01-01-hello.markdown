I am Vignesh and this site serves to provide a **deeper understanding** of the projects I've worked on till now.   
  
Most people would just list their projects on Github and call it a day - this, however, does not usually do justice to all the hard work and intelligence behind beautiful creations. I try to take a different approach here by giving you a **visual demonstration**, aided by succinct explanations for a given product.    
  
The **project titles** are listed on the side panel, prefixed by the year of its completion.

Happy reading!
